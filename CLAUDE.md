# CLAUDE.md â€” CashPilot

## Overview
Self-hosted passive income platform with a web UI that guides setup, deploys Docker containers for 14 catalog services, and tracks earnings from the current bandwidth and DePIN baseline in a unified dashboard.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| FastAPI | Backend framework (Python 3.14, async) |
| Jinja2 | Server-rendered HTML templates |
| SQLite | Database (aiosqlite, zero-config, stored in `/data`) |
| Docker SDK for Python | Container lifecycle management via socket |
| PyYAML | Service definition parsing |
| APScheduler | Periodic earnings collection |
| httpx | Async HTTP client for earnings collectors |
| cryptography (Fernet) | At-rest encryption for stored credentials |
| Chart.js | Frontend earnings charts |
| su-exec | Drops root to the `cashpilot` user after entrypoint setup (Dockerfile) |
| pytest | Testing |
| MkDocs | Documentation |

## Development

```bash
# Local development
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Run dev environment
docker compose up -d

# Build docs
mkdocs serve
```

Two containers: `cashpilot-ui` (port 8080, web dashboard + earnings collection) and `cashpilot-worker` (port 8081, Docker agent requiring socket access).

### Adding a New Service

1. Create `services/{category}/{slug}.yml` following `_schema.yml`
2. **Include a `cashout` section** in the YAML â€” every service must define how users can cash out (API endpoint, redirect URL, or manual instructions). This is mandatory.
3. Regenerate README.md service tables and documentation navigation with the catalog scripts; add `docs/guides/{slug}.md`
4. Add a collector in `app/collectors/{slug}.py` and register it in `__init__.py`
5. Submit a PR (one service per PR)

### Key Design Decisions

- **YAML is the source of truth.** Every service lives in `services/{category}/{slug}.yml`. The web UI, container deployment, earnings collection, and documentation ALL derive from these files. Never hardcode service-specific logic in `app/`.
- **Container naming:** All managed containers are `cashpilot-{slug}` with labels `cashpilot.managed=true` and `cashpilot.service={slug}`.
- **Data directory:** `/data` volume holds SQLite DB and persistent config. Never write outside `/data` at runtime.
- **Credentials:** Encrypted at rest with Fernet using a key at `/data/.fernet_key`, auto-generated when absent and overridable via `CASHPILOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (the file wins; the env var is adopted whenever no key file exists, which covers both a fresh install and a restore). This is NOT `CASHPILOT_SECRET_KEY`, which signs sessions (`/data/.secret_key`).
- **Catalog tables are generated.** Update YAML, then run `python scripts/generate_readme_tables.py` and `python scripts/sync_docs_nav.py`.

## UI + Worker Architecture

CashPilot is split into two **always-separate** components. The UI never touches Docker â€” all container operations go through workers.

### Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CashPilot UI** | The single web dashboard. Collects all earnings centrally, shows global fleet view, manages workers. **Has NO Docker socket.** Can be hosted anywhere. Only ONE UI instance exists. |
| **CashPilot Worker** | Agent running on each server that has Docker. **Must have Docker socket access**. Manages local containers, reports status to UI via heartbeats. Has a minimal config page. |

Two separate Docker images:
- **`drumsergio/cashpilot`** â€” UI image: FastAPI, Jinja2, templates, static assets, collectors, APScheduler. **No Docker SDK.**
- **`drumsergio/cashpilot-worker`** â€” Worker image: FastAPI (minimal), Docker SDK, heartbeat timer, tiny config page. No collectors, no templates.

**There is no standalone mode.** Every server that runs Docker containers needs a worker. The UI is a pure dashboard/scheduler.

### Core Principles

1. **Separation of concerns.** UI handles: dashboard, earnings collection, scheduling, user auth. Workers handle: Docker container lifecycle, health reporting.
2. **Workers must be privileged.** A worker without Docker socket is useless.
3. **Single source of truth.** The UI instance is the only one that collects earnings and stores historical data.
4. **Earnings are never duplicated.** Since only the UI collects, there is no risk of double-counting.
5. **Workers are stateless satellites.** A worker knows which containers to keep running and the UI URL to report to.
6. **Drill-down per server and per service.** The UI shows global totals by default with per-server drill-down.

```

### Authentication & Credential Flow

- **Per-worker fleet keys** (v1.0.0+): `CASHPILOT_API_KEY` is the shared **enrollment/bootstrap** key. On a worker's first heartbeat the UI issues it a unique key (stored encrypted on the UI, returned once, persisted on the worker under `/data/.worker_key`); thereafter each worker authenticates â€” in both directions â€” with its own key, and the shared key is rejected for an enrolled worker.
- Credentials are Docker-native: UI sends full container spec (image, env vars, volumes, ports) to worker on deploy. Worker passes to Docker API. Docker stores env vars in container config. Restarts preserve env vars natively.

### Worker Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|:--------:|---------|-------------|
| `CASHPILOT_UI_URL` | Yes | -- | URL of the CashPilot UI |
| `CASHPILOT_API_KEY` | Yes | -- | Shared API key for worker-to-UI auth |
| `CASHPILOT_WORKER_NAME` | No | hostname | Human-readable name for this worker |
| `CASHPILOT_WORKER_NETWORK` | No | detected | `residential`/`hosting`; overrides the DMI-vendor guess |
| `CASHPILOT_EGRESS_DETECT` | No | on | `off` disables the hourly public-IP lookup |
| `CASHPILOT_EGRESS_IP` | No | -- | State the public IP directly (validated; a LAN/tailnet address is rejected) |
| `CASHPILOT_EGRESS_IP_URL` | No | -- | Custom IP-echo endpoint returning a bare IP |

### Egress IP awareness (CashPilot-5qc)

Providers cap per **IP**, not per device, so two workers behind one home
connection are one customer to the provider and the second earns nothing. Each
worker reports its public egress IP (`system_info.egress_ip`) and a
hosting/residential hint (`system_info.egress_network_type`); `app/egress.py`
groups the fleet by exit and `app/preflight.py` warns before a conflicting
deploy.

Three invariants that must not be "simplified" away:

- **Undetected is not shared.** A worker with no detected IP produces no
  conflict finding and is bucketed as undetermined.
- **Private addresses are detection failures.** `100.64/10` is both CGNAT and
  the tailnet range every reference-fleet worker uses; grouping on it would put
  the whole fleet into one fabricated conflict.
- **An absent `devices_per_ip` is undocumented, not unlimited.** `0` is a
  verified no-limit and *downgrades* the warning to a shared-bandwidth note (it
  does not silence it); only write it when the provider actually says so.

Note that heartbeat container entries key the service as **`slug`**; code that
filtered on `service` silently matched nothing in production. Use
`egress.container_slug()`.

### Dashboard UI Features

- **Expandable instance rows**: Multi-node services show expand chevron with per-instance status, CPU/memory, and action buttons.
- **Per-instance actions**: Sub-row buttons target the correct node via `?worker_id=X` query parameter.
- **CPU/Memory averaging**: Multi-instance services show average (prefixed with `~`) in main row, individual in sub-rows.
- **Notification bell**: Polls `/api/collector-alerts` every 60s. Red badge with count on collector failures.
- **External services**: Services deployed outside Docker appear with "External" badge, no container actions.

### Multi-Currency & Exchange Rates

- `app/exchange_rates.py` fetches crypto-to-USD from CoinGecko (free) and USD-to-fiat from Frankfurter API. Cached, refreshed every 15 min.
- Each collector returns its native currency in `EarningsResult.currency` (for example MYST or USD).
- Frontend converts via `/api/exchange-rates`. Display currency auto-detected from locale, user-overridable in Settings.

## Key Rules
- Never hardcode credentials; all secrets via environment variables
- Docker images: `drumsergio/cashpilot` with semver tags, never `:latest`
- Worker requires Docker socket access (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
- Always use bind mounts (not named volumes) on Unraid
- License: GPL-3.0

## CI/CD

### `release.yml` â€” Auto Release

Triggers on push to `main` (paths: `app/`, `services/`, `Dockerfile*`, `requirements*.txt`). Chooses the version bump from conventional-commit markers since the last tag â€” **major** on a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer or `type!:` subject, **minor** on `feat:`, else **patch** â€” then creates an annotated git tag + GitHub Release. Skips if commit message contains `[skip ci]`.

**CRITICAL: NEVER manually create tags or GitHub releases.** The workflow handles version bumping automatically. Manual tags cause `already_exists` conflicts and skip Docker builds.

### `build.yml` â€” Docker Build & Push

Triggers on version tags (`v*`). Lints with ruff, builds multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) via QEMU + Buildx, pushes to Docker Hub.

**Required GitHub Secrets:** `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

## Deployment Notes

### Performance Learnings

- **`container.stats(stream=False)` is slow** (~1-2s per container). Never call in request path. Use `get_status_cached()` for page loads; background health check refreshes every 5 min.
- **`--read-only` breaks Docker socket access**: The entrypoint modifies `/etc/group`. Drop `--read-only` or add tmpfs for `/etc`.
- **Cross-subnet workers**: Ensure Tailscale subnet routing between UI and worker subnets.
- **SQLite data retention**: 400-day retention with daily purge job.
- **Collection interval**: 1 hour. Earnings cached in SQLite, served instantly.
- **Health check deduplication**: Multi-instance services record only one health event per slug per check cycle (best status wins).
- **Google Fonts**: Use async preload pattern to avoid blocking page render.
- **First earnings baseline**: a platform's FIRST reading has no predecessor, so it contributes nothing to any earned figure â€” the delta is only taken when a previous reading exists in the same currency. No synthetic row is written, and none should be: inventing a prior-day balance would make the first real reading look like a gain.

### Service-Specific: MystNodes / Mysterium

- `MYSTNODES_API_KEY` env var required to link node to cloud account.
- Node identity lives in Docker volume (`mysterium-data:/var/lib/mysterium-node/keystore/`). Deleting volume = new identity.
- Registration is blockchain-based (Polygon). Hermes "internal error" = temporary server issue.
- Image: `mysteriumnetwork/myst` (NOT `mysteriumnet/myst`).
- **Needs `/dev/net/tun`, not just `NET_ADMIN`.** Without the device the node starts, registers and advertises normally but cannot carry wireguard/dvpn traffic â€” so it looks healthy, earns nothing, and MystNodes emails "unable to track its status". Diagnose with `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4050/node/monitoring-agent-statuses` (look for `tun_device_problem`) and `docker exec <container> ls -l /dev/net/tun`. **Fixed in v1.5.1+:** the catalog declares it (`docker.devices` in `services/bandwidth/mysterium.yml`), so a CashPilot-deployed container gets it automatically; only containers created before that need recreating. The device ceiling in `app/worker_api.py` (`_ALLOWED_DEVICES`) is `/dev/net/tun` alone, and a service may only request what its own catalog entry declares. See `docs/guides/mysterium.md` for the full runbook.
- A container recreate is safe: the identity lives in the mounted data dir, not the container. Always confirm the address is unchanged afterwards via `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4050/identities`.

## Collector Implementation Status

Working collectors (8 total, in `app/collectors/__init__.py` `COLLECTOR_MAP`):
- **Earn.fm** — Supabase auth, `/v2/harvester/view_balance`
- **IPRoyal** — Email/password auth
- **MystNodes** — Cloud API, email/password auth, per-node earnings
- **PacketStream** — Manual JWT cookie and HTML scraping
- **Proxies.sx** — API-key dashboard collector
- **ProxyRack** — API-key balance collector
- **Repocket** — Firebase auth
- **Traffmonetizer** — JWT balance collector

### Per-Node/Per-Device Earnings

| Service | Per-Device Earnings | Notes |
|---------|:------------------:|-------|
| MystNodes | **Yes** | `GET /api/v2/node` returns per-node 30d MYST earnings |
| ProxyRack | Bandwidth only | `POST /api/bandwidth` with `device_id` â€” no per-device USD |
| All others | No | Account-level balance only |

### API/Dashboard Access Gotchas

| Service | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| **PacketStream** | CAPTCHA blocks login. Need manual JWT from browser. |
| **ProxyRack** | Cloudflare-protected dashboard. Need API key from browser. |
| **Nodepay** | Behind Cloudflare. Requires browser session cookies. |
| **Bytelixir** | hCaptcha blocks login. Manually extract cookie. "Remember Me" sessions last days/weeks. |
