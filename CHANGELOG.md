# Changelog

Every release, grouped by what changed. Generated from commit history.

> **Upgrading?** Read [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) first. This file lists what
> changed; that one lists what you have to *do*. They are not the same, and this
> file cannot be trusted to flag breaking changes — only one commit in the
> project's history carries a breaking-change marker.

Releases before `1.0.0` were recorded by hand and are kept verbatim in
[docs/changelog-0.x-handwritten.md](docs/changelog-0.x-handwritten.md).
