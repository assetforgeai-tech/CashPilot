"""Generate the README service tables from the catalog (CashPilot-9q1).

"YAML is the single source of truth" is the rule this project is built on, and
the README service tables were the one place it was violated: hand-maintained,
so they drifted. That is not hypothetical — the README kept publishing a per-IP
device limit for weeks after the catalog dropped it for being unsourced, which
is the same wrong number in the more visible place.

Adding a service should be one file plus an optional collector. Every extra
place a contributor has to remember is a place a first-time contributor gets it
wrong, gets a review comment, and does not come back.

Run with --check in CI to fail on drift; run with no arguments to rewrite.

Only the regions between the markers are touched, so the surrounding prose,
footnotes and hand-written notes are preserved.
