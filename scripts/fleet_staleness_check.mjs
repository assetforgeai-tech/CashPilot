// heartbeat. The only counter-signal was a grey dot elsewhere on the card, and
// green is the louder signal — the user reads "honeygain, traffmonetizer" as
// running on a machine CashPilot has not heard from in hours.
//
// pytest cannot see this. The renderers live inside a <script> block in a Jinja
// template, and a text assertion on the template would only prove the source
// contains a variable name, not what colour a given worker produces. So the

// worker, and the OUTPUT is inspected.
