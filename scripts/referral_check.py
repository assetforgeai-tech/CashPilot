"""Audit the catalog's referral links against the referral registry.

Referral links are revenue, and nothing used to check them: a link could lose
its code in a domain migration (ProxyBase kept earning $0 on a retired image
for months before anyone looked), or a service could sit in the catalog with a
bare URL while its provider ran a paying program (Bytebenefit spent ~5 months
wrongly dead AND bare -- every signup in that window was unattributed).

The registry is three-valued, because absent is not "no":

    referral.code       the referral code itself. Its presence means the
                        provider has a program AND a code exists; the checker
                        proves the code still appears in signup_url.
    referral.program    true  = provider verified to run a program
                              (with no code yet, that is an ACTION item)
                        false = provider verified NOT to run one
                              (a bare URL is correct, not a gap)
    (neither)           UNKNOWN: nobody has checked. Reported as the research
                        backlog, never failed -- an unresearched fact is not
                        an error, and failing on it would teach people to
                        write `program: false` without checking.

Exit codes: 1 on inconsistencies (always -- these are regressions), and with
--strict also on action items. Unknowns never fail in either mode.
