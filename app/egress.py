"""Egress-IP awareness across the fleet (CashPilot-5qc).

Providers cap per **IP address**, not per device. Some providers treat more than
one active device on a network as "network overused"; others document that extra
devices behind one IP share the same daily cap without increasing earnings.

CashPilot's whole fleet model encourages deploying one service to several
machines — and until now it warned about none of this. Two workers in the same
house are two machines to us and one customer to the provider, so the second
one earns nothing and can get the account flagged.

This is the one check a single-host tool structurally cannot perform, because
seeing it requires knowing about the *other* machines.

Three rules hold this together, and each exists because the opposite is worse
than saying nothing:

* **An undetected egress IP is not a shared one, and not a distinct one.** Two
  workers whose IP we could not determine must never be grouped as if they
  matched, nor reported as separate as if we had checked. They go to a bucket
  that says exactly that.
* **An absent ``devices_per_ip`` means nobody documented it — not "unlimited".**
  The schema uses ``0`` for unlimited, which is a real, deliberate answer. A
  missing key is not. Only ~4 of 50 services declare it today, so reading
  absence as permission would silently bless the exact mistake this module was
  written to catch.
* **A private address is a detection failure.** A worker reporting 192.168.x,
  or a tailnet 100.64/10 address, has told us about its LAN, not its egress.
  Grouping on it would invent a shared IP that does not exist — and on a
  tailnet, would group the *entire* fleet into one false conflict.

Known limitation, stated rather than hidden: grouping is exact-address equality,
so on a **native-IPv6** connection every machine has its own global /128 and two
hosts on one physical line never match. Detecting that properly means grouping
on the delegated prefix, which is a separate design decision. The consequence is
a missed conflict, never a fabricated one — which is the right way round for
this to fail, and the reason it ships as-is.
