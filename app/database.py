    WHY IT EXISTS
    -------------
    A client importing its pre-pairing history sends up to a thousand readings
    per request, and calling ``upsert_earnings`` in a loop commits once per row.
    Every commit is an fsync, and every one of them takes SQLite's write lock —
    so a single import serialised a thousand disk syncs against the server's own
    collector, and request latency tracked disk sync cost rather than row count.

    (The connection is NOT the problem, despite appearances: ``_get_db`` hands
    out a borrowed handle on a shared per-loop connection whose ``close()`` is a
    documented no-op, so the loop was never opening and closing a thousand
    connections. It was committing a thousand times.)

    ONE TRANSACTION ALSO MEANS ALL-OR-NOTHING, which is the behaviour to want
    here: a failure part-way through leaves the caller's history exactly as it
    was rather than half-applied, and the import is idempotent so retrying costs
    a round trip.
