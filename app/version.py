"""The version this image was built as.

Both apps hardcoded ``version="0.1.0"`` while releases are tag-driven and had
reached 1.11.x, so neither image knew or reported what it was. That made UI /
worker skew completely undetectable: an Unraid user updating the CashPilot app
but not the CashPilot Worker app — two separate Community Applications entries,
each on ``:latest`` — ends up running a 1.11 UI against a 1.4 worker, and
nothing in the fleet page, the workers table, the heartbeat or any log says so.
The symptoms surface as unexplained missing data (a worker that never reports an
egress IP, a button that 404s) with no way for the user or a support thread to
identify the cause.

The value is baked in at build time from the release tag. ``dev`` is the honest
answer anywhere else — a checkout, a local ``docker build``, the test suite —
because claiming a release number there would be worse than admitting ignorance.
