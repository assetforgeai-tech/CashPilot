"""Out-of-band alert delivery for CashPilot.

Passive income is unattended by definition, so an alert that only appears in an
open browser tab is an alert nobody sees. This module pushes the ones that matter
somewhere a person actually looks.

Every target is opt-in through an environment variable and the module is entirely
inert until one is set, so existing deployments are unaffected. Delivery is
best-effort and never raises: a misconfigured or unreachable notifier must not be
able to break an earnings-collection run.

Configure any combination of:

* ``CASHPILOT_NTFY_URL``          -- full topic URL, e.g. ``https://ntfy.sh/my-topic``
* ``CASHPILOT_WEBHOOK_URL``       -- generic endpoint; receives a small JSON body
* ``CASHPILOT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`` + ``CASHPILOT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID``
