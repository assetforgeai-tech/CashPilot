"""Tell the operator when a newer CashPilot has been released.

WHY THIS EXISTS (CashPilot-w0ss)
--------------------------------
A live fleet sat **33 releases** behind and nothing anywhere said so. Not the
dashboard, not a log line, not the fleet page.

Half the machinery was already here: ``app/version.py`` knows what this build is
and ``version.skewed()`` compares it against each worker. What was missing is a
reference point OUTSIDE the deployment -- nothing in the application had any idea
what the newest published release was.

THREE CONSTRAINTS, and they are the difference between a useful feature and an
unwelcome one:

* **Degrade silently when offline.** An air-gapped or firewalled install must not
  show an error, a spinner, or a warning about the check itself. Unknown is
  unknown -- the same rule the rest of this codebase follows for absent data.
* **Never auto-update.** This deploys containers and holds credentials. It tells
  you; you decide.
* **Answerable.** ``CASHPILOT_UPDATE_CHECK=off`` disables the outbound call
  entirely, for anyone who does not want their install talking to GitHub.

The check is a single unauthenticated GET to the public releases endpoint, once a
day. It sends no telemetry: GitHub learns an IP asked what the latest release is,
and nothing else. There is no request body, no identifier, and no version
reported upstream.
