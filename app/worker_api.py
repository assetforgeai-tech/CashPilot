    is under /mnt/user/... — so a blanket /mnt deny made Storj undeployable through
    the worker on the platform most users run, pushing them to bypass CashPilot
    entirely (strictly worse for security than a scoped exception).

    Deny-by-default is unchanged, and an entry must clear BOTH gates:

    * it may not resolve under a system root (``_NEVER_ALLOWLISTABLE``) at any depth,
      so /run/docker.sock, /var/lib/docker/... and /etc/shadow are refused; and

      root it belongs to, so /mnt/user/storj is accepted but /mnt and /mnt/user
      (the entire array) are not.

    RESIDUAL RISK, stated plainly rather than papered over: this worker resolves
    paths in its OWN mount namespace and cannot see the host filesystem, so a

    resolves differently here than in the Docker daemon. Only allowlist a directory
