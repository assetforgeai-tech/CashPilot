"""No service-specific knowledge in ``app/`` outside the collectors.

The repo states the rule plainly: "YAML is the source of truth. Every service
lives in ``services/{category}/{slug}.yml``. The web UI, container deployment,
earnings collection, and documentation ALL derive from these files. Never
hardcode service-specific logic in ``app/``."

A rule with no test is a preference. This one had already drifted twice:

* 13 per-service credential hints — prose about where to find a token in a
  provider's own UI — lived in a dict inside ``api_collectors_meta``, out of
  reach of anyone editing the service they describe.
* ``api_per_node_earnings`` branched on ``slug == "mysterium"`` and imported
  that collector class by name, so a second service reporting per-node figures
  meant editing a route handler.

``app/collectors/`` is exempt by design — the architecture is explicitly one
collector module per service.
