"""The action-pin audit (from the fabricated `github-script` pin).

`collector-live-check.yml` shipped a 40-character SHA whose first sixteen
characters matched the real v7.0.1 commit and whose tail was invented, with a
comment naming a tag that was never released. GitHub resolves actions before
the first step, so the job failed in setup every night for six nights without
checking a single provider, and the workflow's own alarm -- a step inside that
job -- could not fire.

These tests are offline and inject the resolver, so the suite stays
deterministic: what is pinned here is the DECISION LOGIC, not GitHub's current
tag list. The live behaviour was verified separately against the real API,
including replaying the original broken file.
