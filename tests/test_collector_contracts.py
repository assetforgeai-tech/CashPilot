"""Collector contracts (CashPilot-bfl).

The existing collector tests assert subclassing, async-ness and attribute
presence. None of that notices when a provider renames a field, which is how
the ProxyBase/Repocket/EarnFM breakages shipped: the collector stopped finding
the balance and every test stayed green.

Two honest limits on what this file can do, stated because the alternative is
pretending otherwise:

* A recorded fixture is frozen at the moment it was written. It cannot detect
  that a provider changed its API *today* — only that OUR code no longer reads
  what we said it reads. The nightly ``-m live`` job
  (.github/workflows/collector-live-check.yml) is the only thing here that
  checks reality, which is why it exists.
* The fixtures pin FIELD NAMES the collector depends on. That is the thing that
  actually breaks, and it is checkable without credentials or a network.

What this file therefore guarantees: every collector has a declared contract, a
new collector cannot be added without one, and a refactor that stops reading a
declared field fails CI.
