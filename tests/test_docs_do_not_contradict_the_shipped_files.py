"""CashPilot-4le: the first page a new user reads contradicted the security page.

``docs/getting-started.md`` hand-copied a compose file that

* published the worker's Docker-socket API as ``"8081:8081"`` — on every
  interface — while ``docs/security-defaults.md`` says, in as many words,
  *"The worker API is equivalent to root on that machine. Never publish port
  8081."*
* pinned ``:latest`` for both images, which ``docker-compose.yml``'s own header
  identifies as the cause of issue #188.

Meanwhile the **shipped** ``docker-compose.yml`` binds ``127.0.0.1`` by default,
uses ``expose:`` for the worker so it is never published, and pins a release
series.

A copy drifts. The fix is not to correct the copy — it is to stop having one:
the page now includes the real file through ``pymdownx.snippets``, so the
quickstart and the shipped compose cannot disagree again.

Two smaller drifts fixed alongside:

* ``security-defaults.md`` advertised a "Known gap" about ``:latest`` that had
  been closed. A doc that overstates the project's insecurity costs trust the
  same way an understatement does.
* ``CASHPILOT_PORT`` was described in **three** places as the port the worker
  *listens on*. It is not — the listen port is fixed by the image's ``CMD`` and
  the variable only changes what the worker *advertises*.

# snippet kept telling people to run `image: ...:latest` with a bare
# `"8081:8081"` -- publishing an API that can deploy, stop or remove any
# container on the host, to every interface.
#
# Naming one page was the bug. These check EVERY doc that ships a compose
# snippet.
