"""refine-loop segment 1: guards that did not guard what they claimed.

Five independent places where a check looked like it was protecting something
and was not. None of them changes what the application does; all of them change
what the project can conclude from a green run.

1. The nightly collector-live-check collects **zero** tests — no test carries the
   ``live`` marker — masks pytest's exit 5, and is therefore green every morning.
   "Green" meant both "every provider still matches its collector" and "nothing
   was checked at all", and it was always the second. The masking stays (a job
   that fails every night trains people to ignore it); the empty case now says so
   in the step summary.

2. ``verify-tags`` was the only job in build.yml that talked to Docker Hub
   without logging in, and it discarded stderr. An anonymous rate limit — shared
   per egress IP with every other project on GitHub-hosted runners — printed
   ``MISSING`` for images that had published perfectly, and the ``::error::``
   then asserted a partial release that had not happened. Because verify-tags
   failing fails release.yml's ``build``, which ``publish`` needs, the run then
   withheld the git tag and the GitHub Release for a complete release.

3. release.yml's ``ci`` job — the one the release is actually gated on, since
   test.yml gates nothing — ran the suite on Python 3.12 while both images ship
   3.14. ``uv sync --frozen`` resolves markers per interpreter, so the two gates
   really did install different wheels. This is the shape of CashPilot-de1,
   where a different resolution silently covered 65 of 76 routes.

4. build.yml and lint.yml installed ruff unpinned while release.yml used the
   lockfile's. A ruff release that adds a default rule turned the **release** red
   on a commit that changed nothing, in the same run whose ``ci`` job had just
   passed lint on the pinned version. They also disagreed on scope (``app/`` vs
   ``.``).

5. ``.beads/`` was kept out of git only by ``.git/info/exclude``, which is local
   to one clone and is not itself tracked. The backlog holds real wallet
   addresses and this repository is public, so the protection had to travel with
   the repo.
