"""The shipped compose files must not use :latest (CashPilot-jz3).

The project's own rule is semver tags, never `latest`, and the security posture
claims images are pinned. The example compose files contradicted both: a user
following the quickstart got whatever was pushed most recently, with no way to
know what they were running and a breaking change possible on a routine
`docker compose pull`.

They now pin the major.minor tag, which is a real published tag: patch fixes
still arrive automatically, but a new minor or major needs a deliberate edit.

    appeared nowhere in the file. Following the quickstart therefore installed a

    account could not be created at all. It had been fixed for months. The

    track the newest released major.minor, so this fails the next time the
