"""CashPilot-gn6 / CashPilot-l7t: a release that publishes nothing, silently.

`release.yml` decided what to build from two hand-maintained regexes. Both had
drifted from the Dockerfiles they were meant to mirror:

* The UI regex named 13 of 27 modules, but the UI image does
  ``COPY app/ ./app/`` — the whole directory. A change to any of the other 14
  (payouts, preflight, power, egress, lan_isolation, notify, ...) set
  ``BUILD_UI=false``, which skipped the version step, which left ``new_tag``
  empty, which skipped the tag, the GitHub Release and the whole build job.
  Skipped steps do not fail a run, so the release went GREEN having published
  nothing at all.

* The worker regex omitted ``egress.py`` and ``state_backup.py``, both COPY'd
  into the worker image and imported by ``worker_api`` at runtime. With
  ``build_worker=false`` the pipeline RETAGS the previous image, so the worker
  could be published under a new version tag containing the previous release's
  code — and ``verify-tags`` only runs ``docker manifest inspect``, which a
  retag satisfies.

The fix is to stop restating the Dockerfiles in a regex. These tests assert the
two stay in agreement, so the next module added to either image is covered
without anyone remembering.
