"""CashPilot-5fy: no table of config options, and the precedence is not uniform.

Three settings look identical from the outside — a secret supplied either by an
environment variable or by a file under ``/data`` — and resolve in **different
directions**:

* the credential-encryption key: the **file** wins, because switching keys would
  make every stored credential unreadable;
* the session-signing key: the **environment** wins, because sessions are cheap
  to invalidate.

Both are defensible individually. Together they are impossible to guess, and
nothing documented either — so "I set the env var and nothing changed" had no
answer anywhere in the project.

``docs/configuration.md`` is that answer. This test is what stops it rotting the
way the changelog did: **every ``CASHPILOT_*`` the code actually reads must
appear in the reference**, and the two documented precedence directions must
still match the code.
