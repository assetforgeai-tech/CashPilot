"""Endpoints that exist but that nothing in the UI ever calls.

v1.10.x shipped 35 `/api/**` routes with no frontend consumer. Each one is a
feature that was designed, implemented, tested and then made invisible — the
backend computes the answer and no page ever asks for it. Nothing failed, so
nothing reported it.

The payout queue is the sharpest case and the reason this file exists: a balance
drop was recorded as a PROBABLE payout, and until someone answers "yes, I was
paid" it never counts toward lifetime earnings. There was nowhere to answer. So
a real payout looked exactly like a loss, permanently, which is the opposite of
what the feature was built for.

This guards the endpoints that are wired today. It is deliberately NOT a
list of every route — a test asserting "all 35 are wired" would just be a
failing TODO. It locks in what has been done so it cannot silently rot.
