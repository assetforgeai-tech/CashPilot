"""CashPilot-zfd: prove the auth guard for every route, not for a hand-written list.

``tests/test_audit_guards.py`` checks 14 handler names typed out by hand, and
``test_main_routes.py`` adds one more. There are 75 routes. The other 60 could
lose their guard in a refactor with the whole suite still green — verified by
deleting ``_require_auth_api`` from ``api_exchange_rates``, ``_require_writer``
from ``api_collect`` and ``_require_auth_api`` from ``api_earnings_flatlines``:
2300 passed each time, and an anonymous GET to /api/exchange-rates then served
the full rate table. Every endpoint test patches the guard away before calling
the handler, so nothing anywhere notices when the real one is gone.

The fix is to stop maintaining a list. This drives the real ASGI app with no
session and no key and requires every route to refuse, so a new endpoint is
covered the moment it is registered — the author has to come here and say why
if it is public.

Why the app is driven rather than its source inspected: a first attempt walked
the AST of each handler looking for a guard call and reported 17 unguarded
routes, all of them false. ``api_stop`` delegates to ``_svc_stop``, which
guards; the page routes redirect to /login when ``get_current_user`` returns
None. Both are real protection that a local read of the handler cannot see.
