# Changelog archive — hand-written entries

This is the changelog **exactly as it stood** before [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
began being generated from commit history, kept verbatim and in full.

It is worth keeping rather than discarding for one reason: these entries explain
*why* a change was made and what it means for you, at a length no generated
one-liner reaches. The `[Unreleased]` section below in particular carries the
detailed reasoning behind several fixes that the generated file records only as
a commit subject.

Two things to know when reading it:

- **It stops at 0.2.49.** Everything after that is in the generated
  [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
- **It was maintained by hand, so it was never complete.** That incompleteness
  is precisely why generation was adopted.
- **The prose is verbatim; only the links were rebased.** These entries were
  written when this file sat at the repository root, so relative links such as
  `docs/guides/proxybase.md` would now resolve to `docs/docs/...` and 404. They
  were rewritten to point at the same targets from here. Nothing else changed.

For what you must *do* when upgrading, see [UPGRADING.md](../UPGRADING.md).

All notable changes to CashPilot are documented here.

**Upgrading?** [UPGRADING.md](../UPGRADING.md) lists only the releases that require an
action, with what breaks if you skip them. This file carries the detailed notes
recorded so far; it does not yet cover every release.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **A redeploy no longer silently replaces a container with a different one** (CashPilot-tkd). Every redeploy rebuilt the spec from catalog YAML, and nothing recorded what was actually deployed. If the running container had diverged from the catalog — a bind mount where the catalog declares a named volume, a host path that only existed because of an env substitution — the redeploy produced a *different* container, and the worker destroys the old one before anything can compare them. That is the root cause of the whole 'lost node identity' class of bug: not key management, but memory. CashPilot now records the full resolved spec at deploy time (Fernet-encrypted, since env carries credentials) and rebuilds an existing service from that record. The catalog still supplies the image, so upgrades land, and anything you type on the deploy form still wins, so a credential can be corrected. Where the record and the catalog disagree, the difference is reported back rather than resolved silently. Storj now redeploys without retyping `IDENTITY_DIR`/`STORAGE_DIR`, and supplying a path variable still relocates the data on purpose. The unused `env_vars_encrypted` column is superseded by `spec_encrypted`, added by an automatic migration
- **ProxyBase migrated to the current client** (#103). ProxyBase retired its Docker Hub image and old GHCR org and moved to `proxybase.org`, so the catalog entry no longer worked. The image is now `ghcr.io/proxybaseorg/peer-cli` (digest-pinned, multi-arch amd64/arm64/armv7 — arm64/Raspberry Pi now supported), credentials are the client's current `ID` (relabelled **Access Token**, masked) and `NAME` env vars, every URL points at `proxybase.org`, and datacenter IPs are now marked as accepted (residential still earns most). Existing ProxyBase deployments must be re-deployed with a fresh Access Token — see the [updated guide](guides/proxybase.md)

### Security
- **Stated the security posture, and made the machine-checkable parts fail the build if they drift** (CashPilot-964). New [Security Defaults](security-defaults.md) page setting out three tiers — always on and not configurable, configurable but secure by default, and plain preference — under one principle: you may weaken your own installation, but never by accident and never by default. The audit found a real gap: credential encryption at rest is decided by a **naming convention**, so a collector argument named `cookie`, `seed`, `mnemonic`, `jwt`, `passphrase` or `private_key` would have been stored in plaintext simply because nothing enforced it. The suffix list is widened (reads stay backward compatible, so existing rows are unaffected) and a new test fails if any collector credential would not be encrypted, or is not explicitly listed as public with a reason. This matters ahead of the v2.0.0 wallet work, where a field called `seed` is entirely plausible. The tests also pin: metrics off until enabled, alerting inert until configured, an empty volume allowlist, loopback binding in every compose file, and no telemetry-shaped code anywhere in `app/`
- **Deleting a container's volumes can no longer destroy irreplaceable state by accident** (CashPilot-efx). `remove` with `delete_volumes=true` force-deleted every named volume with no guard whatsoever — the only genuinely irreversible path in the codebase. Some services keep state behind those mounts that has no server-side copy and no backup: Storj's proof-of-work node identity (which carries the held payout balance), Mysterium's node keystore, Anyone Protocol's relay identity key, and ProxyBase Markets' generated wallet, where the volume literally is the money. Services now declare `critical_volumes` in their catalog YAML (by mount target, with a short description of what is lost), and the **worker** refuses the delete with a 409 listing exactly which volumes were protected and why. Enforcement lives in the worker rather than the UI so all deploy/remove entry points are covered. Nothing is removed when the guard fires — the check runs before the container is touched. Pass `allow_delete_critical=true` to proceed deliberately. A slug the worker cannot find in its catalog is treated as unsafe rather than unprotected, so a trimmed image can never silently unlock an irreversible delete
- **Services can declare a device, so Mysterium finally gets `/dev/net/tun`** (CashPilot-6rv). The catalog could declare `cap_add` but not a device, and Mysterium needs a TUN device to carry wireguard/dvpn traffic. Deployed without it the node starts, registers, advertises itself to the network — and earns nothing, looking healthy from every angle CashPilot could see. It took a provider email to surface. Service YAML now supports `devices:`, and `mysterium.yml` declares `/dev/net/tun`. Because a device is a direct line to the kernel, the worker holds a hard allow-list the catalog cannot widen, and each request is scoped to the service whose own YAML declares it — the same per-slug rule already used for capabilities, so one service asking for a device never grants it to the other 49. A host-path remap like `/dev/mem:/dev/net/tun` is judged on the host path
- **The example compose files no longer use `:latest`** (CashPilot-jz3). Following the quickstart gave you whatever was pushed most recently, with no way to know what you were running and a breaking change possible on a routine `docker compose pull` — contradicting both the project's own 'semver tags, never `latest`' rule and the pinning claim in the security posture. They now pin the **major.minor** tag (`drumsergio/cashpilot:1.4`), which is already published by the build: patch fixes still arrive automatically, but moving to a new minor or major is a deliberate edit. A test now fails if `:latest` or an untagged image reappears, or if the UI and worker are pinned to different tags. **Upgrade note:** existing deployments are unaffected until you edit your compose file; to keep tracking every release as before, set the tag back to `:latest` deliberately
- **A service that is running but no longer earning now says so** (CashPilot-kbs). A container can be up and its collector can authenticate happily while the balance never moves — every other view looks healthy, so nothing surfaced it and the user found out by eventually noticing they had stopped being paid. Balances that have not moved for 7 recorded days now raise a distinct `flatline` alert and are listed at `GET /api/earnings/flatlines`. The detection is deliberately conservative, because a report that cries wolf is a report nobody reads: a service with too little history is not flagged, a balance that has always been zero is not flagged (that is a setup problem, not a service that stopped), and a collection outage cannot masquerade as a flat balance because the window counts distinct recorded days. The existing alert cooldown means one notification per service, not one per collection cycle
- **A redeploy no longer silently replaces a container with a different one** (CashPilot-tkd). Every redeploy rebuilt the spec from catalog YAML, and nothing recorded what was actually deployed. If the running container had diverged from the catalog — a bind mount where the catalog declares a named volume, a host path that only existed because of an env substitution — the redeploy produced a *different* container, and the worker destroys the old one before anything can compare them. That is the root cause of the whole 'lost node identity' class of bug: not key management, but memory. CashPilot now records the full resolved spec at deploy time (Fernet-encrypted, since env carries credentials) and rebuilds an existing service from that record. The catalog still supplies the image, so upgrades land, and anything you type on the deploy form still wins, so a credential can be corrected. Where the record and the catalog disagree, the difference is reported back rather than resolved silently. Storj now redeploys without retyping `IDENTITY_DIR`/`STORAGE_DIR`, and supplying a path variable still relocates the data on purpose. The unused `env_vars_encrypted` column is superseded by `spec_encrypted`, added by an automatic migration
- **A credential that is about to expire now says so, before your earnings stop** (CashPilot-aug). Several collectors need a value copied out of a browser and some die within hours. Config entries now record when they were last set, expected credential lifetimes are declared per service with the reason in plain words, and `GET /api/credentials/health` reports each stored credential as `fresh`, `expiring_soon`, `likely_expired` or `no_known_expiry` — never returning the credential value itself. Where a service offers a durable alternative to a short-lived cookie, the report says so while the short-lived one is still the only thing configured
- **A payout on one platform no longer erases earnings on another** (CashPilot-glc). Daily and summary earnings were computed by summing every platform's balance delta and only then clamping the total at zero. On a day a payout landed, that platform's balance fell, and the drop cancelled real earnings on other platforms before the clamp ever ran — so a day you actually earned could report zero. Each platform's delta is now clamped at zero *before* summing, so a payout counts as 'nothing earned there today' and never eats into the rest. A pure payout day reads as zero, never negative. The remaining half of the ledger work — a payouts table, drop detection, a lifetime-earned vs current-balance split, and a projected payout date — is tracked as a follow-on
- **ProxyBase migrated to the current client** (#103). ProxyBase retired its Docker Hub image and old GHCR org and moved to `proxybase.org`, so the catalog entry no longer worked. The image is now `ghcr.io/proxybaseorg/peer-cli` (digest-pinned, multi-arch amd64/arm64/armv7 — arm64/Raspberry Pi now supported), credentials are the client's current `ID` (relabelled **Access Token**, masked) and `NAME` env vars, every URL points at `proxybase.org`, and datacenter IPs are now marked as accepted (residential still earns most). Existing ProxyBase deployments must be re-deployed with a fresh Access Token — see the [updated guide](guides/proxybase.md)

### Security
- **Deleting a container's volumes can no longer destroy irreplaceable state by accident** (CashPilot-efx). `remove` with `delete_volumes=true` force-deleted every named volume with no guard whatsoever — the only genuinely irreversible path in the codebase. Some services keep state behind those mounts that has no server-side copy and no backup: Storj's proof-of-work node identity (which carries the held payout balance), Mysterium's node keystore, Anyone Protocol's relay identity key, and ProxyBase Markets' generated wallet, where the volume literally is the money. Services now declare `critical_volumes` in their catalog YAML (by mount target, with a short description of what is lost), and the **worker** refuses the delete with a 409 listing exactly which volumes were protected and why. Enforcement lives in the worker rather than the UI so all deploy/remove entry points are covered. Nothing is removed when the guard fires — the check runs before the container is touched. Pass `allow_delete_critical=true` to proceed deliberately. A slug the worker cannot find in its catalog is treated as unsafe rather than unprotected, so a trimmed image can never silently unlock an irreversible delete
- **Stored credentials can no longer be silently destroyed, and the encryption key is now documented truthfully** (CashPilot-1ii). Three problems compounded: the README and SECURITY.md both described `CASHPILOT_SECRET_KEY` as the credential-encryption key, but `app/database.py` never read it (that variable signs sessions and lives at `/data/.secret_key`, a different key from `/data/.fernet_key`) — so there was no supported way to supply or restore the encryption key at all; an unwritable `/data` made the app log a warning and continue with an in-memory key, so every restart minted a new one and silently orphaned every stored credential; and a corrupt key file was overwritten with a fresh key, destroying the one artifact that could still decrypt existing values. Now: `CASHPILOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` supplies or restores the key, an existing `/data/.fernet_key` always takes precedence (so setting the variable on a running instance is safe, and a divergence is logged), the key file is created `0o600` rather than chmod-ed after writing, a corrupt key file is preserved instead of replaced, and startup refuses outright when the key cannot be persisted. **Upgrade note:** if your data directory is not writable, CashPilot will now refuse to start instead of quietly losing credentials on the next restart — fix the mount, or set `CASHPILOT_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL_KEY=true` if a throwaway instance is genuinely what you want. Back up `/data/.fernet_key`: without it, stored credentials cannot be decrypted
- CI supply-chain hardening: the build/release/Docker-Hub-sync workflows pin their third-party GitHub Actions (`docker/*`, `softprops/action-gh-release`, `peter-evans/dockerhub-description`) to commit SHAs instead of mutable version tags. Both Docker images now declare a `HEALTHCHECK`, and the worker's Docker Hub description is synced alongside the UI's
- First-run owner creation is now atomic (`INSERT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS`), so two registrations racing on a single setup token can no longer both create an owner — the loser gets a 409 and is directed to log in
- `/metrics` can now require a bearer token: set `CASHPILOT_METRICS_TOKEN` and scrapers must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (constant-time compared). With no token set it stays unauthenticated (Prometheus convention), as before
- Closed a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU in the worker-URL SSRF guard: the UI now connects to the exact IP that passed validation (carrying the original hostname in the `Host` header) instead of letting httpx re-resolve the name at request time, so a record that resolved safe during validation can't flip to a metadata/loopback address for the actual request
- The compose files now bind the dashboard (and, in the fleet compose, the Docker-socket worker) to **loopback by default** instead of `0.0.0.0`. The dashboard can command the worker and the worker's API is equivalent to root on the host, so neither should be internet-exposed out of the box. Set `CASHPILOT_BIND_ADDR` / `CASHPILOT_WORKER_BIND_ADDR` to a chosen interface (or front the UI with an authenticating reverse proxy / use a VPN) to expose deliberately. **Upgrade note:** if you reached the dashboard from another machine over your LAN, set `CASHPILOT_BIND_ADDR` (e.g. `0.0.0.0` or a specific interface) after updating
- Deleting or demoting a user now durably revokes their outstanding session cookies. Previously the revocation lived only in memory, so after a UI restart (deploy, crash, reboot) a deleted or demoted account's still-valid 30-day cookie was honored again with its old role. Revocations are persisted in a `session_revocations` table (which outlives the deleted user row) and restored into the session-epoch cache at startup
- Write-only secrets: `GET /api/config` and `/api/env-info` no longer return stored credential values — only a set/not-set indicator. `CASHPILOT_SECRET_KEY` is never sent to the browser
- Fleet key no longer sent on page load — revealed only via explicit owner-only action (`POST /api/fleet/api-key/reveal`)
- Changing a password invalidates that user's existing sessions via a per-user epoch; the changer stays logged in
- SSRF hardening on worker URLs: cloud-metadata IPs (IPv4 `169.254.169.254` + IPv6 `fd00:ec2::254`) always blocked; IPv6 loopback/link-local and IPv4-mapped bypasses closed; DNS-rebinding guard re-validates the resolved IP before each request
- New opt-in `strict` worker-URL policy; default `permissive` keeps LAN (RFC1918) and Tailscale (CGNAT `100.64.0.0/10`) workers working with no config

### Performance
- SQLite connection sharing: a single pooled connection per event loop instead of open-per-query — faster dashboard loads and less write contention
- bcrypt password hashing/verification now runs off the event loop (`asyncio.to_thread`), so a login or password change no longer blocks every other request on the single uvicorn loop for ~200-500ms
- Added an index on `earnings(date)` (date-filtered history/summary queries no longer full-scan), and the "all-time" history query is defensively capped so a long-lived DB can't return an unbounded row set
- Prometheus HTTP metrics bound their `path` label: `/api/workers/{id}` collapses per-id paths and unknown/scanner paths fold into a single `/{other}` label, so probe traffic can't grow label cardinality without limit

### Added
- **Net profit, not just gross earnings** (CashPilot-f5u). Every dashboard in this space reports what a service *paid* and none report what it *cost to run* — so a service earning EUR 2/month on hardware drawing 15W at EUR 0.30/kWh looks like income when it is a EUR 1.29 monthly loss. `GET /api/earnings/net` now reports gross, estimated electricity cost and net per service, and names the services whose trailing net is negative. Three honesty rules are built in and tested: an estimate is always labelled as one and never presented as a measurement; net is reported **alongside** gross, never instead of it; and with no tariff configured it says the cost is unknown rather than charging zero and rendering gross as profit. A host you do not pay power for (a VPS, whose bill does not move with CPU) is charged nothing, and the idle draw of a machine is shared across its containers rather than billed to each one
- **A pre-deploy reality check tells you what a service will actually do for you** (CashPilot-w58). The catalog shows one generic earnings range, so there was no way to tell before deploying whether a service would work in *your* situation — and several will not. Users found out weeks later, when it had earned nothing. `GET /api/services/{slug}/preflight` now answers that in one or two plain sentences with a clear verdict: a duplicate deployment where only one device per IP is allowed says so and warns that some providers forfeit the balance; a storage node states the disk commitment and that part of the balance is held back and forfeited if the node is abandoned early; GPU and residential-IP requirements are named as preconditions. It **never blocks a deploy** — the goal is informed consent, not a nanny — and it lists what it did *not* check (egress IP type, connection speed, free disk) so a clean result is never mistaken for a guarantee about things nobody looked at
- Self-service password change `POST /api/users/me/password` (all roles, via the avatar menu) and owner reset `POST /api/users/{id}/password`
- `CASHPILOT_WORKER_URL_POLICY`, `CASHPILOT_WORKER_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and `CASHPILOT_WORKER_ALLOW_METADATA` env vars for worker-URL validation
