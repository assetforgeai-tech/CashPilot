## Description

Traffmonetizer lets you monetize your internet traffic by sharing bandwidth with verified businesses. One of the few bandwidth-sharing services that works well on VPS and datacenter IPs in addition to residential connections. Uses a simple token-based authentication passed via command-line arguments. Supports ARM architectures for Raspberry Pi and similar devices.

## Earning Estimates

| Monthly range | $0 - $4 (estimate) |
| Per | device |
| Minimum payout | $5 |

| Payment methods | Crypto, Paypal |

> VPS and datacenter IPs earn less than residential. US/EU locations earn more. The more **unique public IPs** your devices have, the more you earn.

> **Same IP = shared traffic.** Multiple devices on the same public IP are allowed (no ban risk), but traffic is split between them — you don't earn more total. Running on both a phone and server on the same WiFi is pointless. The phone only adds value on cellular data (different IP). Also available on iOS.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
