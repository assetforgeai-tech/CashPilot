## Description

MystNodes (Mysterium Network) is a decentralized VPN and proxy network built on blockchain technology. You earn MYST tokens by running a node that provides VPN, proxy, and data scraping services to users. Requires NET_ADMIN capability and host networking for full functionality. Includes a built-in web UI for node management. Works on both residential and VPS connections.

## Earning Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly range | $0 - $10 (estimate) |
| Per | device |
| Minimum payout | $2 |
| Payout frequency | On request |
| Payment methods | Crypto |

> Earnings in MYST tokens. Residential IPs earn significantly more. Node WebUI at port 4449 for management. VPS accepted. Direct MYST runtime should reuse funded identities/wallets; creating a fresh identity per VPS can require a MYST deposit and should not be the default automation path. Important: after first run, set your beneficiary (settlement) wallet via the node WebUI or CLI to match your mystnodes.com account -- this links on-chain earnings to your cloud dashboard.

> **One node per public IP.** Mysterium strictly enforces one active node per public IP address. Additional nodes on the same IP show as offline and earn nothing. Do not run on a phone if a Docker node is already running on the same network. Use separate public IPs (e.g. dual WAN, different locations) for additional nodes.

> **Port forwarding recommended.** Forward **UDP 56000-56100** to maximize earnings. Without this, nodes get "Strict NAT" status -- many VPN/proxy sessions fail to connect, severely reducing income. Alternatives: enable UPnP on your router (Mysterium uses it automatically), or as last resort, use DMZ. The Docker image runs with `--net host` and `NET_ADMIN` capability.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Value |

| Residential IP | No |
| Minimum bandwidth | None |
| GPU required | No |
| Minimum storage | None |
| Supported platforms | Docker, Windows, Macos, Linux, Android, Browser-Extension |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create an account

Sign up at [MystNodes](https://mystnodes.co/?referral_code=do7v7YOoBBpbOstKQovX2pUvZYKia4ZhH3QIdNtE).

### 2. Get your credentials

After signing up, locate the credentials needed for Docker deployment. These are typically your email/password or an API token found in the dashboard.

### 3. Deploy with CashPilot

In the CashPilot web UI, find **MystNodes** in the service catalog and click **Deploy**. Enter the required credentials and CashPilot will handle the rest.

## Docker Configuration

- **Image:** `mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest`
- **Platforms:** linux/amd64, linux/arm64

### Environment Variables

No environment variables required.

## Troubleshooting

### "Running but not earning" - monitoring failed, quality 0

**Symptom.** The container is up and its logs look healthy. MystNodes emails you
*"we're temporarily unable to track its status"*. The dashboard shows no quality
score, and earnings stay flat.

**Cause.** The node cannot open a TUN device. Mysterium serves `wireguard` and
`dvpn` through `/dev/net/tun`, and without it the node still starts, still
registers, and still advertises itself to the network -- it simply cannot carry
any traffic. Everything looks fine from outside, which is what makes this one
hard to spot.

**Confirm it.** Ask the node itself, on the host running it:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4050/node/monitoring-agent-statuses
```

A TUN problem looks like this:

```json
{"statuses":{"data_transfer":{"tun_device_problem":14},
             "scraping":{"tun_device_problem":14},
             "monitoring":{"connect_fail":5,"tun_device_problem":1}}}
```

And `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4050/node/monitoring-status` returns
`{"status":"failed"}`.

**Check whether the device reached the container:**

```bash
docker exec cashpilot-mysterium ls -l /dev/net/tun
# "No such file or directory" means it did not
```

**Fix.** The container needs the device mapped in, alongside `NET_ADMIN`:

```bash
docker run -d --name cashpilot-mysterium \
  --network host --restart always \
  --cap-drop ALL --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --device /dev/net/tun \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges:true \
  -v /path/to/your/myst/data:/var/lib/mysterium-node \
  mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest \
  --ui.address=0.0.0.0 --tequilapi.address=0.0.0.0 service --agreed-terms-and-conditions
```

Verify it took:

```bash
docker exec cashpilot-mysterium sh -c 'ip tuntap add dev probe mode tun && echo TUN_OK && ip link del probe'
docker logs cashpilot-mysterium 2>&1 | grep -i wireguard | tail -3   # expect "Wireguard: started"
```

**Your identity is safe.** It lives in the mounted data directory
(`/var/lib/mysterium-node/keystore/`), not in the container, so recreating the
container keeps the same node identity and its accumulated reputation. Confirm
with `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4050/identities` -- the address must be unchanged.

**On the host**, `/dev/net/tun` must exist (`ls -l /dev/net/tun`). If it does
not, load the module with `modprobe tun`.

MystNodes' own monitoring takes a while to re-score a node after the fix --
allow several hours before judging it by the dashboard rather than by the node's
own `monitoring-agent-statuses`.

> **Fixed in v1.5.1+.** The catalog now declares `/dev/net/tun` for Mysterium, so
> a container CashPilot deploys gets the device automatically. The manual steps
> above are only needed for a container deployed before that, or one created
> outside CashPilot. Redeploy from the UI and the device comes with it.
