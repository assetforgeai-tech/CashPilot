## Description

ProxyRack's Peer program lets you earn by sharing your bandwidth as part of their proxy network. Each device requires a unique 64-character hex UUID and optionally an API key to auto-register the device. Works on both residential and VPS/datacenter connections. Dashboard is behind Cloudflare, which may require manual browser-based API key retrieval.

## Earning Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly range | $0 - $4 (estimate) |
| Per | device |

> Residential IPs earn more than datacenter. Dashboard behind Cloudflare may complicate automated access.
